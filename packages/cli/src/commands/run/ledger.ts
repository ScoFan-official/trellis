/**
 * Run ledger — one JSONL file per `trellis run`, under
 * `.trellis/.runtime/runs/` (gitignored, same area as `.runtime/sessions/`).
 *
 * Each line is one action the runner took, so a run can be reconstructed
 * after the fact: which ticket, which worker, which commit, which verify
 * command with which exit code, and why the line stopped.
 *
 * The ledger is a runtime trace, NOT a reconciliation source: truth order
 * stays git history > worklog > README `## 进度` (see WORKLOG-PROTOCOL). The
 * close-out step summarizes it into the worklog's 验证 field.
